## 2025-05-14 - Optimized Memory Reading and Text Conversion
**Learning:** In Python, replacing a long if/elif chain (e.g., 50+ conditions) with a dictionary lookup for character conversion provides a significant performance boost (~45% faster). Additionally, using PyBoy's memory slicing (`memory[start:end]`) instead of iterative byte access (`[memory[i] for i in range(start, end)]`) reduces overhead by ~37% for small buffers. For bit counting, `int.bit_count()` in Python 3.10+ is much faster than `bin(b).count("1")`.
**Action:** Always prefer dictionary lookups for fixed mappings and use slicing for bulk memory reads. Use modern Python features like `bit_count()` for bit manipulation.
